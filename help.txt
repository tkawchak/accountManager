Account Manager Help:

Search:
To return to main menu, just press enter without entering any information.
If multiple matches are found, you must narrow down your selection before you can see the details of each account.

Modify:
You will search for an account and then be prompted if that account is the one that you want to update.
In order to maintain information from the account previously, type 'same' or 'keep'.
This feature allows you to change an account and its information.

Create:
Pretty self-explanatory.  Just type in the information to create a new account.
To generate a random password, you may type random, but only for the password category.

Delete:
You will search for a term and then be prompted if that account is the one you want to delete.

Pending Tasks:
This will display the name and tasks of all accounts that have pending tasks to be completed.

Backup:
This will backup all of your account information to a .csv file

Help:
This option displays the message you are reading right now.

Exit:
You will leave the application, sign out, and disconnect from the database

Future Updates:
I plan to make this program to allow multiple users to get access to their own accounts, and create their own settings for things like encryption, backup locations, etc.

Thanks for using my program! Hopefully it helps you keep track of your accounts.
