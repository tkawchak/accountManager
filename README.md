#Account Manager

Python program that allows users to store information about accounts (passwords, login credentials, addresses, websites, etc....).  Each user will have to set up a password and default filepath locations to start, and will be able to create, modify, search, delete, and backup all of the accounts.  the accounts are encrypted and then stored in an sqlite3 database.
